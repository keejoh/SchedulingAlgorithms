# SchedulingAlgorithms
Operating Systems: Based on array with random int values and a head position run scheduling algorithms FCFS and SSTF
This program creates an array of random numbers and then asks the user to input the current position of the head between 0 and 999. 
The program then runs the First Come First Serve and Shortest Seek Time First algorithms 
and finds the corresponding total head movement for the requests made (which are found in the random numbers array). 
This program functions as desired.
